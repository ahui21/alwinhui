    <h1>What Global Cities Are Most At Risk of Climate Hazards?</h1>
    <h2>Cities will face significant risk of climate hazards, if they haven't already. What trends can we see from the data?</h2>

        <p>Of the 100 cities in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, 60 of them are currently facing a climate hazard with a magnitude level of "High", with another 17 and 5 facing ones of "Medium High" and "Medium", respectively. That means fewer than 20% of these cities are not already currently facing a climate hazard with significant magnitude.</p>
        <p>Geographically, we can see there is largely no correlation between geography and magnitude of their climate hazard, as cities around the world in different latitudes and longitudes all face "High" magnitude climate hazards. However, most of the cities facing "High" and "Medium High" magnitude climate hazards are located near coastlines, which makes sense given the impact of sea levels on many different climate hazards (flooding, hurricanes, water stress, etc.). However, given most major cities are located near coastlines, there is not a big enough sample size of non-coastline cities for a conclusive comparative analysis.</p>
        <p>Correlations do exist between geography and type of climate hazards as well, which we observe when we filter certain climate hazards. For example, we see heavy precipitation will be a more dangerous climate hazard primarily in Europe and the Americas, with it being a relatively less dangerous hazard in Asia. Similarly, river flooding will be a more dangerous climate hazard primarily in Europe and the East Coast of the Americas, with most of Africa and Asia being unaffected.</p>

        <p>We now turn our attention to the probability of these climate hazards. Of the 100 cities, 64 of them are currently facing a climate hazard with a probability level of "High", with another 12 and 3 facing ones of "Medium High" and "Medium", respectively. That means fewer than 25% of these cities are not already currently facing a climate hazard with a significant probability.</p>
